# java-asteroids

 I revisited Asteroids in the summer before Junior year, in order to learn how to program in Java for AP CSA. It was a lot easier this time around. It was a fun experience, and I think since my implementation of Asteroids in C++, I have evolved a lot. Compared to my C++ implementation, I used more built-in functions, because some Java libraries were more accessible. I also randomly generated the sprites rather than used predetermined ones.
